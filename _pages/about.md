Hi everyone! I’m Hang Yu (Demo) — thanks so much for visiting my homepage.
I received my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Macau, where I completed my undergraduate thesis in Prof. Jiantao Zhou’s laboratory. I later earned my Master’s degree in Robotics and Autonomous Systems from Boston University.

**Research Interests** are at the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotic control. I'm particularly interested in
1. Learning from Video for Robotic Control – using large-scale video data to teach robots visuomotor skills and motion imitation.
2. Video Generation and Visual World Modeling – developing generative models (e.g., diffusion and transformer-based architectures) to simulate and predict physical interactions.
3. Multi-Robot Collaboration – enabling coordinated behaviors across humanoid, quadruped, and manipulator systems through communication and shared policy learning.
4. Embodied and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models – integrating perception, language, and action for generalizable embodied reasoning.

Main experience
======
Currently, I am conducting research in Embodied AI at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou campus) under Prof. Haoang Li. My current projects explore video generation and embodied AI.

From February to May 2025, I worked at Autel Robotics in Shenzhen, China, where I conducted research on reinforcement learning for humanoid and quadruped robots in simulation environments using Isaac Sim. My work centered on policy optimization, balance control, and motion coordination for real-world deployment of legged and anthropomorphic robots.

During the summer of 2024 (May–August), I worked as a research assistant in the Lab of Brain-Inspired Open-World Intelligence Computing at the Guangdong Institute of Intelligent Science and Technology under Dr. Chaoran Yang. My research focused on integrating Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) into diffusion-based visuomotor policies to enhance biological plausibility, temporal dynamics, and energy efficiency in robotic manipulation.
