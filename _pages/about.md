Hi everyone! I’m **Hang Yu (Demo)** — thank you for visiting my homepage.  
I received my **Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science** from the **University of Macau**, where I completed my undergraduate thesis under **Prof. Jiantao Zhou**. I later earned my **Master’s degree in Robotics and Autonomous Systems** from **Boston University**.

### 🧠 Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of **Embodied AI**, **robot learning**, and **computer vision**, with the goal of building intelligent systems that can *see, reason, and act* in the physical world.  

I am particularly interested in:
1. **Learning from Video for Robotic Control** – leveraging large-scale video data to teach robots visuomotor skills and motion imitation.  
2. **Video Generation and Visual World Modeling** – developing generative models (e.g., diffusion and transformer architectures) to simulate and predict physical interactions.  
3. **Multi-Robot Collaboration** – enabling coordinated behaviors across humanoid, quadruped, and manipulator systems through communication and shared policy learning.  
4. **Embodied and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models** – integrating perception, language, and action for generalizable embodied reasoning.
