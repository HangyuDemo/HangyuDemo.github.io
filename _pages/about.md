Hi everyone! This is Hang Yu (Demo). Thank you guys so much for visiting my homepage. I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer science from the University of Macau. I completed my graduation thesis in Jiantao Zhou's laboratory. I will receive my Master's degree in Robotics and Autonomy Systems from Boston University.

**Research Interests** are at the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotic control. I'm particularly interested in
1. The application of diffusion model to robotics arm manipulation.
1. The application of large language model in robot cooperation and joint work.

Main experience
======
During the summer of 2024, from May to August, I conducted research on the correlation between robotic arm control and neural computing in the lab of Dr. Chaoran Yang at the Guangdong Institute of Intelligent Science and Technology.

Currently, I am working at Autel in Shenzhen, China, where I focus on research related to robot collaboration. My work primarily involves using simulation environments like Isaac Lab to explore and develop techniques for improving inter-robot coordination and enhancing their collaborative capabilities.
