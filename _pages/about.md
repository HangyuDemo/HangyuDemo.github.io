Hi everyone! This is Hang Yu (Demo). Thank you guys so much for visiting my homepage. I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer science from the University of Macau. I completed my graduation thesis in Jiantao Zhou's laboratory. I will receive my Master's degree in Robotics and Autonomy Systems from Boston University.

**Research Interests** are at the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotic control. I'm particularly interested in
1. The application of diffusion model to robotics arm manipulation.
1. The application of large language model in robot cooperation and joint work.

I'm still working on my page.

Main experience
======
During the summer vacation from May to August 2023, I conducted a research on the correlation between robotic arm control and cranial nerves in the project of Dr. Yang Chaoran of Guangdong Institute of Intelligent Science and Technology.

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, 

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template.
