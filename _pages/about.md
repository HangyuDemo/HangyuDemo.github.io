Hi everyone! This is Hang Yu (Demo). Thank you guys so much for visiting my homepage. I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer science from the University of Macau. I completed my graduation thesis in Jiantao Zhou's laboratory. I will receive my Master's degree in Robotics and Autonomy Systems from Boston University.

**Research Interests** are at the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotic control. I'm particularly interested in
1. The application of diffusion model to robotics arm manipulation.
1. The application of large language model in robot cooperation and joint work.
